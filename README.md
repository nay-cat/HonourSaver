   - Load your saved games and select the GUID of the Honor Mode save you want to recover. Refer to the image for guidance.

4. **Click "Reactivate Honour Mode":**

Any error with your save?

When using this tool a backup is created with your profile8.lsf file just in case, if you notice any error when opening the game, simply delete the modified file and remove the “.backup” from the profile8.lsf.backup file name.

### Know Issues
